## By developers and for developers

I am an iOS developer and currently learning Swift.

This project is inspired by [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) and [Allen朝辉](https://twitter.com/creativewang)'s [30DaysSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift).

Unlike above projects coded by designers, my original goal is not only to implement general features in Swift, but also focus on code style and architecture design. 

**This repo does not merely follow tutorials, I re-architecture them with better code style and design.**

For code style, I strictly follow [raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide);

For developers, I have a README file and screenshots for every single project, you can start coding from there.

## Whats's next?

I will maintain the project with latest syntax and most advanced code style. More code comments is going to be covered as well.

Also, **unit tests** will be added to ensure the quality of the codebase.
