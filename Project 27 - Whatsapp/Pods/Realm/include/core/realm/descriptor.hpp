/// Accessor for table type descriptors.
///
/// A table type descriptor is an entity that specifies the dynamic
/// type of a Realm table. Objects of this class are accessors
/// through which the descriptor can be inspected and
/// changed. Accessors can become detached, see is_attached() for more
/// on this. The descriptor itself is stored inside the database file,
/// or elsewhere in case of a free-standing table or a table in a
/// free-standing group.
///
/// The dynamic type consists first, and foremost of an ordered list
/// of column descriptors. Each column descriptor specifies the name
/// and type of the column.
///
/// When a table has a subtable column, every cell in than column
/// contains a subtable. All those subtables have the same dynamic
/// type, and therefore have a shared descriptor. See is_root() for
/// more on this.
///
/// The Table class contains convenience methods, such as
/// Table::get_column_count() and Table::add_column(), that allow you
/// to inspect and change the dynamic type of simple tables without
/// resorting to use of descriptors. For example, the following two
/// statements have the same effect:
///
///     table->add_column(type, name);
///     table->get_descriptor()->add_column(type, name);
///
/// Note, however, that this equivalence holds only as long as no
/// shared subtable descriptors are involved.

    /// Note that a link is *not* considered broken when it is replaced by a
    /// link to the same target row. I.e., no no rows will be cascade-removed
    /// due to such an operation.
    ///
    /// When a row is explicitly removed (such as by Table::move_last_over()),
    /// all links to it are automatically removed or nullified. For single link
    /// columns (type_Link), links to the removed row are nullified. For link
    /// list columns (type_LinkList), links to the removed row are removed from

    /// When a row is cascade-removed there can no longer be any strong links to it,
    /// but if there are any weak links, they will be removed or nullified.

    /// It is important to understand that this cascade-removal scheme is too
    /// simplistic to enable detection and removal of orphaned link-cycles. In
    /// this respect, it suffers from the same limitations as a reference
    /// counting scheme generally does.
    ///
    /// It is also important to understand, that the possible presence of a link

    /// modified. This happens, for example, if two rows, A and B, have strong
    /// links to each other, and there are no other strong links to either of
