namespace realm {

// Views, tables and synchronization between them:
//
// Views are built through queries against either tables or another view.
// Views may be restricted to only hold entries provided by another view.
// this other view is called the "restricting view".
// Views may be sorted in ascending or descending order of values in one ore more columns.
//
// Views remember the query from which it was originally built.
// Views remember the table from which it was originally built.
// Views remember a restricting view if one was used when it was originally built.
// Views remember the sorting criteria (columns and direction)
//
// A view may be operated in one of two distinct modes: *reflective* and *imperative*.
// Sometimes the term "reactive" is used instead of "reflective" with the same meaning.
//
// Reflective views:
// - A reflective view *always* *reflect* the result of running the query.
//   If the underlying tables or tableviews change, the reflective view changes as well.
//   A reflective view may need to rerun the query it was generated from, a potentially
//   costly operation which happens on demand.
// - It does not matter whether changes are explicitly done within the transaction, or
//   occur implicitly as part of advance_read() or promote_to_write().
//
// Imperative views:
// - An imperative view only *initially* holds the result of the query. An imperative
//   view *never* reruns the query. To force the view to match it's query (by rerunning it),
//   the view must be operated in reflective mode.
//   An imperative view can be modified explicitly. References can be added, removed or
//   changed.
//
// - In imperative mode, the references in the view tracks movement of the referenced data:
//   If you delete an entry which is referenced from a view, said reference is detached,
//   not removed.
// - It does not matter whether the delete is done in-line (as part of the current transaction),
//   or if it is done implicitly as part of advance_read() or promote_to_write().
//
// The choice between reflective and imperative views might eventually be represented by a
// switch on the tableview, but isn't yet. For now, clients (bindings) must call sync_if_needed()
// to get reflective behavior.
//
// Use cases:
//
// 1. Presenting data
// The first use case (and primary motivator behind the reflective view) is to just track
// and present the state of the database. In this case, the view is operated in reflective
// mode, it is not modified within the transaction, and it is not used to modify data in
// other parts of the database.
//
// 2. Handover
// The second use case is "handover." The implicit rerun of the query in our first use case
// may be too costly to be acceptable on the main thread. Instead you want to run the query
// on a worker thread, but display it on the main thread. To achieve this, you need two
// SharedGroups locked on to the same version of the database. If you have that, you can
// *handover* a view from one thread/SharedGroup to the other.
//
// Handover is a two-step procedure. First, the accessors are *exported* from one SharedGroup,
// called the sourcing group, then it is *imported* into another SharedGroup, called the
// receiving group. The thread associated with the sourcing SharedGroup will be
// responsible for the export operation, while the thread associated with the receiving
// SharedGroup will do the import operation.
//
// 3. Iterating a view and changing data
// The third use case (and a motivator behind the imperative view) is when you want
// to make changes to the database in accordance with a query result. Imagine you want to
// find all employees with a salary below a limit and raise their salaries to the limit (pseudocode):
//
//    promote_to_write();
//    view = table.where().less_than(salary_column,limit).find_all();
//    for (size_t i = 0; i < view.size(); ++i) {
//        view.set_int(salary_column, i, limit);
//        // add this to get reflective mode: view.sync_if_needed();
//    }
//    commit_and_continue_as_read();
//
// This is idiomatic imperative code and it works if the view is operated in imperative mode.
//
// If the view is operated in reflective mode, the behaviour surprises most people: When the
// first salary is changed, the entry no longer fullfills the query, so it is dropped from the
// view implicitly. view[0] is removed, view[1] moves to view[0] and so forth. But the next
// loop iteration has i=1 and refers to view[1], thus skipping view[0]. The end result is that
// every other employee get a raise, while the others don't.
//
// 4. Iterating intermixed with implicit updates
// This leads us to use case 4, which is similar to use case 3, but uses promote_to_write()
// intermixed with iterating a view. This is actually quite important to some, who do not want
// to end up with a large write transaction.
//
//    view = table.where().less_than(salary_column,limit).find_all();
//    for (size_t i = 0; i < view.size(); ++i) {
//        promote_to_write();
//        view.set_int(salary_column, i, limit);
//        commit_and_continue_as_write();
//    }
//
// Anything can happen at the call to promote_to_write(). The key question then becomes: how
// do we support a safe way of realising the original goal (raising salaries) ?
//
// using the imperative operating mode:
//
//    view = table.where().less_than(salary_column,limit).find_all();
//    for (size_t i = 0; i < view.size(); ++i) {
//        promote_to_write();
//        // add r.sync_if_needed(); to get reflective mode
//        if (r.is_row_attached(i)) {
//            Row r = view[i];
//            r.set_int(salary_column, limit);
//        }
//        commit_and_continue_as_write();
//    }
//
// This is safe, and we just aim for providing low level safety: is_row_attached() can tell
// if the reference is valid, and the references in the view continue to point to the
// same object at all times, also following implicit updates. The rest is up to the
// application logic.
//
// It is important to see, that there is no guarantee that all relevant employees get
// their raise in cases whith concurrent updates. At every call to promote_to_write() new
// employees may be added to the underlying table, but as the view is in imperative mode,
// these new employees are not added to the view. Also at promote_to_write() an existing
// employee could recieve a (different, larger) raise which would then be overwritten and lost.
// However, these are problems that you should expect, since the activity is spread over multiple
// transactions.
