/// A SharedGroup facilitates transactions.
///
/// When multiple threads or processes need to access a database
/// concurrently, they must do so using transactions. By design,
/// Realm does not allow for multiple threads (or processes) to
/// share a single instance of SharedGroup. Instead, each concurrently
/// executing thread or process must use a separate instance of
/// SharedGroup.
///
/// Each instance of SharedGroup manages a single transaction at a
/// time. That transaction can be either a read transaction, or a
/// write transaction.
///
/// Utility classes ReadTransaction and WriteTransaction are provided
/// to make it safe and easy to work with transactions in a scoped
/// manner (by means of the RAII idiom). However, transactions can
/// also be explicitly started (begin_read(), begin_write()) and
/// stopped (end_read(), commit(), rollback()).
///
/// If a transaction is active when the SharedGroup is destroyed, that
/// transaction is implicitly terminated, either by a call to
/// end_read() or rollback().
///
/// Two processes that want to share a database file must reside on
/// the same host.
///
///
/// Desired exception behavior (not yet fully implemented)
/// ------------------------------------------------------
///
///  - If any data access API function throws an unexpected exception during a
///    read transaction, the shared group accessor is left in state "error
///    during read".
///
///  - If any data access API function throws an unexpected exception during a
///    write transaction, the shared group accessor is left in state "error
///    during write".
///
///  - If SharedGroup::begin_write() or SharedGroup::begin_read() throws an
///    unexpected exception, the shared group accessor is left in state "no
///    transaction in progress".
///
///  - SharedGroup::end_read() and SharedGroup::rollback() do not throw.
///
///  - If SharedGroup::commit() throws an unexpected exception, the shared group
///    accessor is left in state "error during write" and the transaction was
///    not committed.
///
///  - If SharedGroup::advance_read() or SharedGroup::promote_to_write() throws
///    an unexpected exception, the shared group accessor is left in state "error
///    during read".
///
///  - If SharedGroup::commit_and_continue_as_read() or
///    SharedGroup::rollback_and_continue_as_read() throws an unexpected
///    exception, the shared group accessor is left in state "error during
///    write".
///
/// It has not yet been decided exactly what an "unexpected exception" is, but
/// `std::bad_alloc` is surely one example. On the other hand, an expected
/// exception is one that is mentioned in the function specific documentation,
/// and is used to abort an operation due to a special, but expected condition.
///
/// States
/// ------
///
///  - A newly created shared group accessor is in state "no transaction in
///    progress".
///
///  - In state "error during read", almost all Realm API functions are
///    illegal on the connected group of accessors. The only valid operations
///    are destruction of the shared group, and SharedGroup::end_read(). If
