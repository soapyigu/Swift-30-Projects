/// The \c LogicError exception class is intended to be thrown only when
/// applications (or bindings) violate rules that are stated (or ought to have
/// been stated) in the documentation of the public API, and only in cases
/// where the violation could have been easily and efficiently predicted by the
/// application. In other words, this exception class is for the cases where
/// the error is due to incorrect use of the public API.
///
/// This class is not supposed to be caught by applications. It is not even
/// supposed to be considered part of the public API, and therefore the
/// documentation of the public API should **not** mention the \c LogicError
/// exception class by name. Note how this contrasts with other exception
/// classes, such as \c NoSuchTable, which are part of the public API, and are
/// supposed to be mentioned in the documentation by name. The \c LogicError
/// exception is part of Realm's private API.
///
/// In other words, the \c LogicError class should exclusively be used in
/// replacement (or in addition to) asserts (debug or not) in order to
/// guarantee program interruption, while still allowing for complete
/// test-cases to be written and run.
///
/// To this effect, the special `CHECK_LOGIC_ERROR()` macro is provided as a
/// test framework plugin to allow unit tests to check that the functions in
/// the public API do throw \c LogicError when rules are violated.
///
/// The reason behind hiding this class from the public API is to prevent users
/// from getting used to the idea that "Undefined Behaviour" equates a specific
/// exception being thrown. The whole point of properly documenting "Undefined
/// Behaviour" cases is to help the user know what the limits are, without
/// constraining the database to handle every and any use-case thrown at it.
///
/// FIXME: This exception class should probably be moved to the `_impl`
/// namespace, in order to avoid some confusion.
