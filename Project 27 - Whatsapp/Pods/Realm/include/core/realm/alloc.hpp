    /// \brief The version of the format of the the node structure (in file or

    ///
    /// Every allocator contains a file format version field, which is returned
    /// by this function. In some cases (as mentioned below) the file format can
    /// change.
    ///
    /// A value of zero means the the file format is not yet decided. This is
    /// only possible for empty Realms where top-ref is zero.
    ///
    /// For the default allocator (get_default()), the file format version field
    /// can never change, is never zero, and is set to whatever
    /// Group::get_target_file_format_version_for_session() would return if the
    /// original file format version was undecided and the request history type
    /// was Replication::hist_None.
    ///
    /// For the slab allocator (AllocSlab), the file format version field is set
    /// to the file format version specified by the attached file (or attached
    /// memory buffer) at the time of attachment. If no file (or buffer) is
    /// currently attached, the returned value has no meaning. If the Realm file
    /// format is later upgraded, the file form,at version filed must be updated
    /// to reflect that fact.
    ///
    /// In shared mode (when a Realm file is opened via a SharedGroup instance)
    /// it can happen that the file format is upgraded asyncronously (via
    /// another SharedGroup instance), and in that case the file format version
    /// field of the allocator can get out of date, but only for a short
    /// while. It is always garanteed to be, and remain up to date after the
    /// opening process completes (when SharedGroup::do_open() returns).
    ///
    /// An empty Realm file (one whose top-ref is zero) may specify a file
    /// format version of zero to indicate that the format is not yet
    /// decided. In that case, this function will return zero immediately after
    /// AllocSlab::attach_file() returns. It shall be guaranteed, however, that
    /// the zero is changed to a proper file format version before the opening
    /// process completes (Group::open() or SharedGroup::open()). It is the duty
    /// of the caller of AllocSlab::attach_file() to ensure this.
    ///
    /// File format versions:
    ///
    ///   1 Initial file format version
    ///
    ///   2 FIXME: Does anybody remember what happened here?
    ///
    ///   3 Supporting null on string columns broke the file format in following
    ///     way: Index appends an 'X' character to all strings except the null
    ///     string, to be able to distinguish between null and empty
    ///     string. Bumped to 3 because of null support of String columns and
    ///     because of new format of index.
    ///
    ///   4 Introduction of optional in-Realm history of changes (additional
    ///     entries in Group::m_top). Since this change is not forward
    ///     compatible, the file format version had to be bumped. This change is
    ///     implemented in a way that achieves backwards compatibility with
    ///     version 3 (and in turn with version 2).
    ///
    ///   5 Introduced the new Timestamp column type that replaces DateTime.
    ///     When opening an older database file, all DateTime columns will be
    ///     automatically upgraded Timestamp columns.
    ///

    /// the file validity checks in AllocSlab::validate_buffer(), the file
